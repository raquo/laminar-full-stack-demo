// -- Routes --

// Note: For every URL covered by these routes, the backend should
// serve the index.html file that loads your application.
// In Server.scala, we do this for `/` and for every URL under `/app`.

// Note: there is also NotFoundPage, but it does not have a designated
// URL of its own (like /404): we retain the URL that the user entered to
// give the user a chance to fix it.
// And so, even though NotFoundPage does not have its own route listed
// here, JsRouter.currentPageSignal still emits it when necessary.
